                <p>This project is an exhibition app for mobile and desktop, showcasing information about the works and the artists participating on the pop-up.
                   We intend to use this as a tool to present our own work as a cohort. It is also useful for the visitors to resort to, both during and after the exhibit.
                </p>
                <p> We used this opportunity to collaborate in real time using tools as Figma and GitHub. We followed a design process where we, iteratively, researched, ideated,
                    prototyped a product and refined it according to the user testing results. We researched heavily on how to implement an accessible application for a wide range of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the future development of this project, we would like to include some back-end functionalities, specifically a way of generating multiple static pages from one template. Another goal is to make this application also a tool for us, as a group, to organize and curate the exhibition.
                    Lastly, there are multiple design features that we would like to implement, in order to improve navigation, like filtering the works by category or location.
